Instructions for updating:
Use `for ... in dataset:` to iterate over a dataset. If using `tf.estimator`, return the `Dataset` object directly from your input function. As a last resort, you can use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(dataset)`.
From /home/fleaven/Documents/AI/OCR/HCCR-HWDB-tensorflow-master/models/basiccnn2.py:53: The name tf.nn.max_pool is deprecated. Please use tf.nn.max_pool2d instead.

Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
Large dropout rate: 0.7 (>0.5). In TensorFlow 2.x, dropout() uses dropout rate instead of keep_prob. Please ensure that this is intended.

Instructions for updating:
To construct input pipelines, use the `tf.data` module.
`tf.train.start_queue_runners()` was called when no queue runners were defined. You can safely remove the call to this deprecated function.

From /home/archlab/AI/simple-cr/data.py:58: DatasetV1.make_one_shot_iterator (from tensorflow.python.data.ops.dataset_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `for ... in dataset:` to iterate over a dataset. If using `tf.estimator`, return the `Dataset` object directly from your input function. As a last resort, you can use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(dataset)`.
From /home/archlab/AI/simple-cr/models/basiccnn3.py:53: The name tf.nn.max_pool is deprecated. Please use tf.nn.max_pool2d instead.

Instructions for updating:
keep_dims is deprecated, use keepdims instead
From /home/archlab/AI/simple-cr/models/basiccnn3.py:119: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
Large dropout rate: 0.7 (>0.5). In TensorFlow 2.x, dropout() uses dropout rate instead of keep_prob. Please ensure that this is intended.

Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
From /home/fleaven/Documents/AI/OCR/HCCR-HWDB-tensorflow-master/train.py:91: The name tf.log is deprecated. Please use tf.math.log instead.

From /home/fleaven/Documents/AI/OCR/HCCR-HWDB-tensorflow-master/train.py:102: The name tf.train.Saver is deprecated. Please use tf.compat.v1.train.Saver instead.

From /home/fleaven/Documents/AI/OCR/HCCR-HWDB-tensorflow-master/train.py:117: start_queue_runners (from tensorflow.python.training.queue_runner_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
To construct input pipelines, use the `tf.data` module.
`tf.train.start_queue_runners()` was called when no queue runners were defined. You can safely remove the call to this deprecated function.

Instructions for updating:
Use `for ... in dataset:` to iterate over a dataset. If using `tf.estimator`, return the `Dataset` object directly from your input function. As a last resort, you can use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(dataset)`.

Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
Large dropout rate: 0.7 (>0.5). In TensorFlow 2.x, dropout() uses dropout rate instead of keep_prob. Please ensure that this is intended.
